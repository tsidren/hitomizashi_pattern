# hitomizashi_pattern
In Hitomezashi stitch pattern we can make a representation of the binary numbers in the form of a cool design 
Actually, it was used for creating stitching patterns. 
but I saw it as a colouring problem 
how should I implememt it? [^1]

## Initial Setup 
### Python programs 
- For installing Python in your system follow [this](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?t=109&si=nSMND0BaJhe_u5CS)

## test drive 
- Run "main.py" from the initial directory.[^2]

[^1}: I've written some comments explaining my approach in the code itself.
[^2]: You can also run 'colouringX' and 'testX' files files they have different approaches applied to them.
